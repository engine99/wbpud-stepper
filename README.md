# wbpud-stepper
Arduino windowblind puller-upper-downer with a stepper motor. Opens a blind at sunrise, closes at sunset.

I set this up with a Trinket, USBtiny85 programmer, NEMA 17 motor, and SN754410 Quadruple Half-H Driver.

Blind could be over-rotated and damaged if isOpen or TURNS are not set appropriately.
